# Ride-Analysis

# 🚗 Ride Analysis

A data analytics project focused on understanding trends, patterns, and insights from ride-sharing datasets. This project leverages Python-based data science tools to process, analyze, and visualize ride data to assist in business decision-making and operational efficiency.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze ride data (e.g., ride times, durations, and patterns) using:

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* **Time-based Feature Engineering**
* **Interactive Visualizations with Matplotlib & Seaborn**
* **Deployment via Streamlit Dashboard**

## 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Streamlit**
* **Jupyter Notebooks**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wassupjay/Ride-Analysis.git
cd Ride-Analysis
```

### 2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run Ride_Analysis.py
```

## 📌 Key Features

* Extracts hour and time slot features from timestamps
* Identifies peak ride hours and frequency
* Highlights anomalies and trends through visual exploration
* Deployable as a lightweight Streamlit dashboard

## 📷 Sample Visualizations

> Add images to show line plots, bar graphs, or time heatmaps

## 💡 Future Enhancements

* Integrate with real-time APIs for live data monitoring
* Add predictive analytics (e.g., ride demand forecasting)
* Deploy as a web app with authentication
